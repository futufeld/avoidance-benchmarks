# Obstacle Avoidance Benchmarks

## Overview

This program benchmarks disc avoidance in goal-aligned xetrov collision avoidance. It does so by randomly generating discs in the vicinity of a vehicle's position. Two cases are considered:

- Case 1: All obstacles are too distant from the vehicle to perturb the potential field at its location.
- Case 2: All obstacles affect the potential field at the position of the vehicle.

The benchmark consists of:

- Determining the source point on all discs.
- Calculating the potential generated by the disc at the vehicle's position.
- Accumulating all potentials.
